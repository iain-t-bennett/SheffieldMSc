In this report the problem of adjusting for treatment switching in the context of an oncology clinical trial is described. A selection of methods reported in the literature is reviewed and then implemented in a series of simulation studies where time to progression is forced to be correlated with overall survival a realistic scenario. The results of these simulations suggest that simple methods should be avoided as they can exhibit extreme bias in situations where such correlation exists. In contrast the complex adjustment methods of a Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time (RPSFT) model and the two-stage accelerated failure time method appear to often be less biased than the ITT approach.
