\chapter{Additional plots for all simulations}

\label{A:allres}
This Appendix contains additional plots showing combined results of Simulation Study 1 described in Chapter \ref{C:chap_sim2} and Simulation Study 2 described in Chapter \ref{C:chap_sim3}. Based on Section \ref{S:chap_intro:correlation} and \cite{Ciani2014} only results for a realistic range for the correlation between time to progression and overall survival are presented in this Appendix. That is only the correlations of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 are presented here. Care should be taken when examining these plots as the y axis are not constant. Table \ref{T:chap_con:scenarios} shows the description for each of the 21 basis scenarios.
