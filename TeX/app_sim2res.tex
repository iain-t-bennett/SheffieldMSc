\chapter{Additional results of Simulation Study 1}

\label{A:sim2res}

This Appendix contains additional results for the simulation study described in Chapter \ref{C:chap_sim2}. Figure \ref{F:app_sim2:compA_bias} shows the bias and Figure \ref{F:app_sim2:compA_cov} the coverage of each of the complex methods after the imputations discussed in Section \ref{S:chap_sim2:convimp} were applied. Overall the results are similar to that seen without these imputations.
