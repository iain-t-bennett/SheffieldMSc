	\LHead{Introduction}

	Using time series data, our main objective is the study of genetic regulatory networks. In particular, we are interested on inferring the gene regulatory kinships for a given process.  When stated in a graphical manner such relationships are represented as edges and the genes as nodes;  these edges can be directed or not, and feedback loops and cliques may or may not be allowed.

	We use regression based dynamic Bayesian networks, with $y_i^{t+1} = f_i (\bl y^t) + \varepsilon_i^{t+1}$, where $y_i^{t}$ is the measurement of unit $i = 1, \dots, G$, at time $t = 1, \dots, T$, $\bl y^t = \set{ y_1^t,  y_2^t, \dots, y^t_G}$ and $\varepsilon_i^t$ is an idiosyncratic error term.  The functional forms of the interactions, $f_i(\cdot)$, are usually unknown.  Whether $\partial y_i^{t+1} / \partial y_j^t \equiv 0$ or not defines the topology of the network.

	Specifying a parametric form for $f_i(\cdot)$ (power, exponential, Michaelis-Menten, etc.) entails a large number of parameters and may be feasible only for large $T$.  Misspecification of the shape may yield a spurious estimate of the network topology.

	\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{A flexible way of including unknown non-linearities is to use a semi-parametric specification by letting the interactions be described by spline functions.}} 
\end{textblock}

\begin{textblock}{7}(0,7)
	\LHead{Methods}

	We use a flexible, non-parametric setting for the mean level,
	\begin{gather*}
		\eta_g^t = f_{g1}(y^{t-1}_{1})+  f_{g2}(y^{t-1}_{2}) + \dots +  f_{gG}(y^{t-1}_{G}) + \mu_g  \; ,
		\shortintertext{where}
		f_{gi}(y_i) = \sum_{k=1}^M \beta_{ik}^g B_{ik}(y_i) \; .
	\end{gather*}
	Here, $\mu_g$ is the unit-specific constant term,  $M= r + l$, where $l$ is the degree of the spline with $M$ basis functions $B_{ik}(y_i)$ defined over the set, $\bl \kappa_i$, of $r$ evenly spaced knots

	Stacking the bases and the coefficients into $ X^t =\set{X_1^t, \dots, X_G^t} \in \Real^{MG}$ and $\bl \beta_g = \set{\bl \beta_{1g}, \dots, \bl \beta_{Gg}} \in \Real^{MG}$, respectively, we can express the model as $y_{g}^{t+1} = \mu_g +  X^t \bl{\beta}_g + \varepsilon_{g}^t$ and after further stacking the equation*s over time we have,
	\begin{equation*}
		\bl y_g = \bl \mu_ g + \mathcal X \; \bl \beta_g + \bl \varepsilon_g  \; , \qquad g =1, \dots, G \; .
	\end{equation*}

	\vspace*{3in}



	\Subhead{A parametric alternative}

	In order to compare the network retrieval power of the splines model, we entertain a fully parametric, linear AR(1) alternative
	\begin{equation*}
		y_g^{t+1} = \mu_g + \sum_{j=1}^G \beta_{jg} y_j^t + \varepsilon_g^t .
	\end{equation*}
\end{textblock}


\begin{textblock}{7}(0,20)

	\LHead{Usual checks}

	We performed two \emph{in silico} experiments with $G= 16$, $T= 40$, and $\rho  \approx 0.1$. One with only linear and the second with a number of non-linear (S-shaped) relations.

	\LHead{Microarray data}

	The data are a subset of a time series of gene expression profiles of \emph{Arabidopsis} leaves generated using microarrays. The same (numbered) leaf is sampled at each time point, which means it is not possible to monitor the same plant over the entire time series. Hence at each of the 24 time points (every 2 hrs for 48 hrs), gene expression profiles were measured in leaf 7 of 4 distinct plants grown in identical conditions.
