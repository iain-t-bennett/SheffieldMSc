@article{Austin2012,
	Abstract = {Simulations and Monte Carlo methods serve an important role in modern statistical research. They allow for an examination of the performance of statistical procedures in settings in which analytic and mathematical derivations may not be feasible. A key element in any statistical simulation is the existence of an appropriate data-generating process: one must be able to simulate data from a specified statistical model. We describe data-generating processes for the Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates when event times follow an exponential, Weibull, or Gompertz distribution. We consider three types of time-varying covariates: first, a dichotomous time-varying covariate that can change at most once from untreated to treated (e.g., organ transplant); second, a continuous time-varying covariate such as cumulative exposure at a constant dose to radiation or to a pharmaceutical agent used for a chronic condition; third, a dichotomous time-varying covariate with a subject being able to move repeatedly between treatment states (e.g., current compliance or use of a medication). In each setting, we derive closed-form expressions that allow one to simulate survival times so that survival times are related to a vector of fixed or time-invariant covariates and to a single time-varying covariate. We illustrate the utility of our closed-form expressions for simulating event times by using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the statistical power to detect as statistically significant the effect of different types of binary time-varying covariates. This is compared with the statistical power to detect as statistically significant a binary time-invariant covariate. Copyright {\copyright}2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {In parallel group trials, long-term efficacy endpoints may be affected if some patients switch or cross over to the alternative treatment arm prior to the event. In oncology trials, switch to the experimental treatment can occur in the control arm following disease progression and potentially impact overall survival. It may be a clinically relevant question to estimate the efficacy that would have been observed if no patients had switched, for example, to estimate ‘real-life’ clinical effectiveness for a health technology assessment. Several commonly used statistical methods are available that try to adjust time-to-event data to account for treatment switching, ranging from naive exclusion and censoring approaches to more complex inverse probability of censoring weighting and rank-preserving structural failure time models. These are described, along with their key assumptions, strengths, and limitations. Best practice guidance is provided for both trial design and analysis when switching is anticipated. Available statistical software is summarized, and examples are provided of the application of these methods in health technology assessments of oncology trials. Key considerations include having a clearly articulated rationale and research question and a well-designed trial with sufficient good quality data collection to enable robust statistical analysis. No analysis method is universally suitable in all situations, and each makes strong untestable assumptions. There is a need for further research into new or improved techniques. This information should aid statisticians and their colleagues to improve the design and analysis of clinical trials where treatment switch is anticipated. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract ={Background. Treatment switching commonly occurs in clinical trials of novel interventions in the advanced or metastatic cancer setting. However, methods to adjust for switching have been used inconsistently and potentially inappropriately in health technology assessments (HTAs). Objective. We present recommendations on the use of methods to adjust survival estimates in the presence of treatment switching in the context of economic evaluations. Methods. We provide background on the treatment switching issue and summarize methods used to adjust for it in HTAs. We discuss the assumptions and limitations associated with adjustment methods and draw on results of a simulation study to make recommendations on their use. Results. We demonstrate that methods used to adjust for treatment switching have important limitations and often produce bias in realistic scenarios. We present an analysis framework that aims to increase the probability that suitable adjustment methods can be identified on a case-by-case basis. We recommend that the characteristics of clinical trials, and the treatment switching mechanism observed within them, should be considered alongside the key assumptions of the adjustment methods. Key assumptions include the “no unmeasured confounders” assumption associated with the inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) method and the “common treatment effect” assumption associated with the rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM). Conclusions. The limitations associated with switching adjustment methods such as the RPSFTM and IPCW mean that they are appropriate in different scenarios. In some scenarios, both methods may be prone to bias; “2-stage” methods should be considered, and intention-to-treat analyses may sometimes produce the least bias. The data requirements of adjustment methods also have important implications for clinical trialists.},

These included simple methods which are commonly used in medical literature and may be subject to selection bias if patients switching are not typical of the population as a whole. Methods which attempt to adjust the estimated treatment effect, either through adjustment to the hazard ratio or via accelerated failure time models, were also considered. A simulation study was conducted to assess the performance of each method in a number of different scenarios.",

Clinicians may insist that the experimental treatment be made available, at least as a rescue medication, for all patients in the control arm. A method for estimating a treatment effect in survival data from randomized clinical trials of this type is developed under an accelerated failure time model. This approach retains all patients in the groups to which they were randomized and is not based on an ad hoc subgroup analysis. By conditioning on having observed patient switch times, this method avoids the need to model patient switching patterns in the analysis. This new approach is evaluated using simulation studies, and is illustrated through analysing data from a Medical Research Council lung cancer trial. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract ={Aim: Overall survival (OS) as an endpoint in trials of first-line therapy is challenging due to the effect of post-study therapy (PST). OS benefit may not be observed despite a clear benefit in progression-free survival. This exploratory analysis of the first-line EURTAC study assesses the effect of erlotinib on OS, using two statistical models to control for second-line (2L) PST use.Methods: Patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer were randomised to receive once-daily erlotinib (E) or 4–6 cycles of chemotherapy (C). OS, calculated from date of randomisation to death, was assessed by Kaplan–Meier methodology. In this analysis, two statistical methods controlled for 2L PST use; method 1: the original Cox proportional hazard model was used, with OS censored at the time of 2L PST initiation, to evaluate OS only when patients were not receiving 2L PST; method 2: a Cox model adjusting for 2L PST exposure in the OS analyses where ‘2L PST exposure’ was incorporated as a time-dependent covariate (allowing for differential effects for E and C).Results: Baseline characteristics were balanced between the arms (E, n = 86; C, n = 88). In the protocol-specified analysis (data cut-off 11 April 2012), the hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.92 (95% CI 0.63–1.35, p = 0.68; median OS 22.9 vs 19.6 months for E vs C). When adjusted for baseline factors (age, gender, ECOG PS, smoking history and EGFR mutation type), the HR was 0.86 (95% CI 0.58–1.27). A total of 58% of patients received 2L PST (tyrosine-kinase inhibitors: 31% E, 58% C; platinum compounds: 44% E, 5% C; antimetabolites: 48% E, 19% C). Median time to initiation of 2L PST from time of disease progression (n = 102) was 0.85 months for E and 0.36 months for C. Using method 1, the HR was 0.68 (95% CI 0.37–1.25, p = 0.21; median OS was not reached with E vs 20.8 months with C). The adjusted HR was 0.63 (95% CI 0.34–1.19). Using method 2, the HR was 0.69 (95% CI 0.38–1.26), with an adjusted HR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.35–1.20).Conclusions: These exploratory results suggest a trend towards a survival benefit for first-line E vs C, which was previously unobserved due to the confounding factor of non-randomised 2L PST use.Disclosure: L.F.
