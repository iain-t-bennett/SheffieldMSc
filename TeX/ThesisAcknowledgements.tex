I would like to thank the many people within and outside of Roche with whom I have had many interesting discussions on the issue of treatment switching. In particular my supervisor Dr Kevin Carroll for suggesting the impact of correlation between PFS and OS as an interesting topic to investigate and helpful comments on early drafts of this dissertation. Thanks are also due to my manager Pierre and all the members of the MORSE team for facilitating my extended ``holidays'' in Sheffield over the past 3 years. Belated thanks go to my parents for their encouragement and support in many ways.

Finally, I would like to thank Patricia for her patience, support and love throughout my studies.
